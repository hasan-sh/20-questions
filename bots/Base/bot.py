    The class representing the questioner bot Basebot. 
    This bot asks random questions from the KG. 
    If answer is yes:
        1- A sparql query is constructed from the triple used to ask the question. All instances where the subject appears as
        subject (in the previous KG) are retrieved and a new sub-KG is constructed from them.
        2- the triple itself is removed along with all triples where the predicate and object matches. 
    If answer is no:
        1- All entities where the predicate object combination holds are filtered out. 
    In addition all questions' triples are saved to history.s
