    initializeState : Boolean
        Decides whether the state should be initialized, meaning that either the bot will start with the KG queried
        on type or not. 

    Methods
    -------
    update(question, answer)
        Keeps track of the amount of questions asked and what questions are answered yes/no to, each time a question is asked. 

    updateGraph()?

    createSubGraph()
        Minimize the graph each time an answer is given. This function makes use of yesHints and noHints to query the graph.
